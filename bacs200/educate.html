    <li>If students feel like they are in a constant procrastination mood, it can lead to a build up anxiety in their life, making it hard to give their all to  thier studies.</li>
    <li>Simple things to help with procrastination: defining and prioritizing tasks, breaking up big tasks in smaller parts, creating a reward system, setting a schedule and eliminating distractions.</li>

<ul><h3>Ideas:</h3>
    <li>Redifining what leadership is, where usually people see it as being someone who will change the world and who has earned to be a leader, but actually it doesn't have to be that way - every day of our lives brings opportunities to be leaders and change others’ lives for the better.</li>

    <li>Not only should you keep your eyes open for ways to be a leaders in someone’s day, but take time to celebrate yourself and others’ as leaders in your life.</li>
