<h1>My favorite group: BTS</h1>
<img src="https://blog.ticketmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/TMBlog-BTS-FanFAQPost-1024x614-v1.jpg" alt="Picture" width="400">
<p>There are a lot of different people who can inspire in various ways, we have athletes, actors, singers etc. For me these individuals have usually accomplished something with their hard work and tenacious character, they didn’t give up when obstacles were put in their way and just kept griding to become the best version of themselves. </p>
<p>That’s why I admire this group called BTS, also known Bangtan Sonyeondan, Bangtan Boys, or Beyond The Scene. This is a band from South Korea that is made up of seven members. They debuted in 2013 with company called “Big Hit”. Currently, they are know for their massive fanbase named “Army” and their global outreach, but it wasn’t always like that.</p>
<p>The company, that the group was under, was really small and didn’t really have the biggest budget, so on their debut they weren’t the most popular or “can’t wait to hear them” group. But they started to gain a little bit of popularity with their unique music style and the way they presented it. Their music often carries messages around social issues, therefore their audience/listeners can relate to a lot of the feelings and lyrics that the songs provide.</p>
<p>Their popularity kept growing with time where now their one of the most influenced boy groups of 21st century. But trough out their journey to success each BTS members struggled in their own way to make it to where they are today, but despite all of the odds against them, they made it where they are today. Moreover, each member has their own individual personality and talents that help make BTS so amazing!
